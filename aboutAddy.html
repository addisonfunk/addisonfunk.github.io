                <h2>Hey! I'm Addison, and I <em>really</em> love technology.</h2>
                <p>It all started once upon a time when I worked in marketing and realized that I spent my days tracking web developer tools on different websites. Needless to say, I found out it was time for a career change that fueled this passion. Marketing is still really intriguing to me, but web development is my home base. Honestly, I am not afraid of change. It shows strength and a willingness to try new things. Bring it on!
                <br><br>
                Currently, I work at an ed tech start-up, which is really awesome. That being said, all thoughts here are my own and are non-affiliated. 
                <br><br>
                New projects are really exciting to me, and it is safe to say that I can't live without Bootstrap. Recently, I have been pretty obsessed with Flexbox Grid [you must check it out], and I am excited to look into Bricks.js and the new HTTP2... did you know HTTP hasn't been updated since 1997?? Yeah, I'm excited too.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I believe life is all about change. Innovation. New beginnings. Seeing something new in the old. Being able to create virtual spaces for users to experience is really exciting. I feel like I am apart of making their lives easier and more accessible to the world around us, which is a pretty cool feeling.

                <h2>Tech is like a butterfly.</h2>
                Stay with me here. My mom would always point out butterflies to me. Anytime we were on a walk, browsing a shop or looking online, if there was a butterfly (real or printed), she made sure I caught a glance. I never really understood her obsession until she explained how they were a sign of beautiful change, which is what life is all about (now you know who I get it from!). 
                <br><br>
                She really had some merit, though. I have definitely had days where I felt like a caterpillar... where it seemed like brighter days were too far away, but mom would tell me to be thankful for these days because they help you appreciate 'the butterfly days.' Don't tell her I said this, but she was right. 
                <br><br>
                When I found the world of web development, I felt like I had officially found my place. It's a pretty amazing world. I knew that when I started to dream in code, my brain was telling me how it excited it was for the journey ahead. Now, here I am, continuing on my web development journey, because let's be real: technology is always changing. Everything ahead is so exciting. Life is always good.
