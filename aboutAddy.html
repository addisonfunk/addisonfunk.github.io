                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hey! I'm Addison, and I <em>really</em> love technology.</h3>
                <p>It all started once upon a time when I worked in marketing and realized that I spent my days tracking web developer tools on different websites. Needless to say, I found out it was time for a career change that fueled this passion. Marketing is still really intriguing to me, but web development is my home base. Honestly, I am not afraid of change. It shows strength and a willingness to try new things. Bring it on!
                <br><br>
                Currently, I work at an ed tech start-up, which is really awesome. That being said, all thoughts here are my own and are non-affiliated.</p>

                <h2>Hey! I'm Addison, and I'm <em>obsessed</em> with butterflies.</h2>
                <p>Why butterflies? I'm glad you asked. To put it simply, they are a sign of beautiful change. Honestly, if I could put myself in a cocoon and come out with wings [aka -- never have to pay for a flight again], I'd be pretty amazed.<br><br>
                Anyway, aside from the physical magic of butterflies, they have special meaning in my life. My mom always told me to 'look for the butterflies'. I didn't really realize what she was talking about for awhile. I live in a city... looking for them took some effort. But one day, I came out of my own cocoon and it all made sense.<br><br>
                Life is all about change. Innovation. New beginnings. Seeing the light...even when you're stuck in a cocoon. My mom has taught me a heck of a lot about life, but this mom-ism was good.

                <h2>My wings begin with tech, design and travel.</h2>
                I used to work in digital marketing, so innovation was key in my work. But there was a point in my life when I felt like I was falling behind in everything to do with tech... AHH!

                <p>I love exploring new technologies (which happens constantly - it's awesome), but I still have that list of trusty resources I hold near and dear. I really love Bootstrap, and recently, I have been pretty obsessed with Flexbox Grid [you must check it out], and I am excited to keep practicing React/Redux and the new HTTP2... did you know HTTP hasn't been updated since 1997?? Yeah, I'm excited too.

                Anyway, I believe life is all about change. Innovation. New beginnings. Seeing something new in the old. Being able to create virtual spaces for users to experience is really exciting. I feel like I am apart of making their lives easier and more accessible to the world around us, which is a pretty cool feeling.</p>

                <p>Stay with me here. My mom would always point out butterflies to me. Anytime we were on a walk, browsing a shop or looking online, if there was a butterfly (real or printed), she made sure I caught a glance. I never really understood her obsession until she explained how they were a sign of beautiful change, which is what life is all about (now you know who I get it from!).

                I knew that when I started to dream in code, my brain was on track to the nerdy, techy brain it is today. It took some work to get in the right mindset with this new language, but I am confident that anyone who puts their mind to do it can be a tech guru in no time!
                <br><br>
                Design has always come naturally to me. It is like an outlet for my creative side. I love it! I usually get all kinds of inspiration from traveling [everywhere and anywhere]. There is honestly nothing more exciting than planning a trip to explore somewhere completely new.

                She really had some merit, though. I have definitely had days where I felt like a caterpillar... where it seemed like brighter days were too far away, but mom would tell me to be thankful for these days because they help you appreciate 'the butterfly days.' Don't tell her I said this, but she was right. 
                <br><br>
                When I found the world of web development, I felt like I had officially found my place. It's a pretty amazing world. I knew that when I started to dream in code, my brain was telling me how it excited it was for the journey ahead. Now, here I am, continuing on my web development journey, because let's be real: technology is always changing. Everything ahead is so exciting. Life is always good.</p>
